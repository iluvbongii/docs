uLaunch is an entirely separate category within uxento, devoted to serious deployers who wish to stay ahead of the curve when launching coins. Within uLaunch you will find a CT tracker panel, and a multi-feed panel which will display posts in real time from tracked accounts/feeds any of can be used to deploy a new coin. To do so, simply click Deploy to be taken to the [uDev Launch Panel](/udev#how-to-launch-coins-with-udev%3A) where you may use any of the custom uDev Tools [(sniper/bundler/multi-deployer etc.)](/udev#sniper%2Fbundler%3A)

<Warning>
  Please note, the uLaunch CT Tracker is a separate tracker tailored for devs. We do not recommend buying coins from this feed as many devs have access to add accounts to the uLaunch CT Tracker.
</Warning>

## Add Custom X Accounts:

One defining feature of uLaunch is the ability to track your own X accounts in the uLaunch CT Tracker. To do this, simply navigate to the [Content Filters](#content-filters%3A) settings by clicking the Filter icon above your uLaunch CT Panel.

<Frame caption="Content Filters Button">
  <img
    src="/images/ulaunch2.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

Within this panel, developers have the ability to add Custom X Accounts they wish to track via the uLaunch CT Tracker. Simply add any X username and add. You must have launched at least 1 coin via uxento for permission to add an account to the uLaunch CT Tracker. [Become a premium user (add any amount of accounts by applying here.)](https://discord.gg/uLaunch.)

You can also manage and filter your tracked CT accounts at any time using this panel. Simply tick/untick as needed or click the quick Enable/Disable All buttons; you may also search usernames, sort by recently added/alphabetical order, or filter only custom accounts by clicking **'Show My Custom'.**

<Frame caption="Content Filters Button">

The uLaunch CT Tracker follows the same CT Tracker AIO & Vision uses 1:1, **except you can also add your own custom accounts in the uLaunch CT Tracker.**

Please note that new accounts are auto-enabled by default but can be disabled manually via your CT Account Filters (located via your uxento [settings button](/uxento-vision#filter-groups%2Ftrackers%3A)) by toggling **'Auto-Enable New Accounts'** off/on. You may also sort tracked accounts by 'Recently Added' in both Content Filter panels.

</Frame>

Accounts added within the last 12 hours will have a 'New' tag displayed on top of them to easily alert you when an account has been recently added. There is also a notification panel (the Bell icon next to your profile avatar) which will alert you whenever a new account is added to your tracker. Ensure to hit the Refresh button when following notifications if new accounts have not shown up in your Filter Settings.

<Danger>
  uxento does not take responsibility for what gets shown in your CT Tracker feeds. We no longer offer any kind of refunds - we've given **YOU** the control to see what **YOU** want to see.
</Danger>

## Content Filters:

Users may also filter all of the content they see in uLaunch. To do this simply navigate to the Content Filters settings to find filters for your uLaunch CT Tracker (as shown above), News Feed, Instagram and Truth Social Trackers. You can manage which accounts are being tracked by unticking/ticking as needed.

<Frame caption>

## uAI + uScraper:

uAI is uLaunchâ€™s in-built AI assistant helping you launch coins quicker than ever by monitoring X accounts and deploying coins based on any given parameters. If any account tracked via uAI makes a post, uAI will quick-deploy a token built around that post.

To enable this, simply click the uAI icon at the top of your uLaunch feed.

<Frame caption="uAI Button">
  <img
    src="/images/uscrapeicon.png"
    alt="uAi"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

You can then choose up to 10 accounts from the uLaunch tracker to monitor, select your preferred platform for launching and the preset amount of SOL you wish to quick-deploy with. uAI will run seamlessly in the background, scanning and launching coins in real-time.

<Frame caption="uAI Settings">
  <img
    src="/images/usconfig.png"
    alt="uAi"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

You may also define AI Prompts for uAI that allow it to better generate Ticker/Name Combinations when generating coins. You can select from any pre-built prompts i.e. First+Last Word Combo, which will extract the first word, and the last meaningful word in the post to create the Coin Name and Ticker; or add your own.

<Frame caption="AI Prompts">
  <img
    src="/images/AIprompts.png"
    alt="uAi"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

If you don't wish for uAI to launch coins automatically, you may use uScraper - a feed style version of uAI which seamlessly monitors posts and generates ideas but allows you to control the deployment.

#### uScraper:

uScraper allows you to define your uAI configuration to consistently monitor tracked X accounts and generate Coin ideas displayed in a separate AI Scraper feed where you can deploy generated ideas at the click of a button.

You can do this by clicking the 'Configure' button at the top of your AI Scraper feed in uLaunch.

<Frame caption="Configure AI Scraper">
  <img
    src="/images/configai.png"
    alt="uAi"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

You may customize the same parameters as above as well as select the option to generate more Name/Ticker ideas (up to 3).

<Frame caption="uScraper Settings">
  <img
    src="/images/uaiset.png"
    alt="uAi"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

uScraper will monitor your selected accounts and generate new Coin ideas seamlessly for you to deploy at the click of a button, or to customize further within the uDev Creator Module.

    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Feed Notifications:

You may configure custom notifications for certain trackers, keywords and accounts via the Feed Notifications button (the bell icon above your uLaunch CT Panel).

<Frame caption="Feed Notifications Button">
  <img
    src="/images/feednotifs.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

<div style={{ marginBottom:"1.5rem" }} />

<Frame caption="Feed Notifications Button">
  <img
    src="/images/feednotifs2.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

Within your feed notification settings, you can set up custom sounds for each individual tracker, as well as manage Keyword/Ticker Alerts and Custom Account Alerts:

#### Ticker/CA Detection:

Automatically detects and highlights any cryptocurrency tickers (such as \$BTC/\$ETH) and/or any Solana contract addresses that are shown on your feed. Simply toggle the feature on/off, and then configure your highlight color and alert sound.

<Frame caption=" ">

    src="/images/detect.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

#### Keyword Alerts:

Get highlighted alerts and custom sounds when specific keywords appear in your feed. You may add individual keywords, add them in bulk, or import/export them in JSON formatting.

<Frame caption="Keyword Alerts Configuration">
  <img
    src="/images/keywordalertsulaunch.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

<div style={{ marginBottom:"1.5rem" }} />

<Frame caption="Active Keyword Alerts">
  <img
    src="/images/activealerts.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

#### Custom CT Account Alerts:

You may also receive the same alerts/notifications for custom CT accounts. Simply search the desired handle and configure the alert settings.

<Frame caption="Active Custom CT Alerts">
  <img
    src="/images/ctalerts.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

#### uLaunch Card Settings:

You may also quickly customize the uLaunch Feed Cards by clicking the Card Settings button (the Wand icon above the CT panel).

<Frame caption="Card Settings Button">
  <img
    src="/images/wand.png"
    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

uLaunch Cards can be color coded for ease of use, and can be made more compact with less visible information for a more streamlined experience. Text size can also be adjusted, allowing you to customize readability to your preference.

<Frame caption="uLaunch Cards are entirely customizable.">

    alt="ulaunch"
    style={{ width:"100%",borderRadius:"12px",display:"block",margin:"0 auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

#### Multi-Feed Tracker:

The Multi-Feed tracker will display Follows/Profile Updates as well as the News Feed if toggled on. Active sources can be managed via the Active Sources button in the top right of the Multi-Feed. Simply tick/untick as needed.

<Frame caption>
  <img
    src="/images/managesources.png"
